<p>The summer of 2016 marked new territory for Cosby Expeditions… the first ever Llama Trek in the mountains of North Carolina! It was a fantastic adventure for the select few who dared to join us for the week of fun. Llamas carried our essentials, needed for spending 3 days in the mountains of North Carolina. The Llama Trek also offers adventurers the opportunity to experience several different outdoor activities including rock climbing and whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River in Tennessee! Our week will feature 1 day of rock climbing, 3 days of trekking through the mountains of North Carolina with our llamas, and will end with our adrenaline-filled day of rafting.</p>
