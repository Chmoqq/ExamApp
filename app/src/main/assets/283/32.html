<p>This camp offers trips for teens with concentrations in Marine Biology, Cultural Immersion, and Expedition. Teens live at Seven Palms Villa, a luxury villa in Runaway Bay, Jamaica. The beach is just a short walk from the villa with an amazing number of marine fish and corals in the reef. Campers snorkel every morning along the shallow reefs of the Caribbean Sea with their lifeguard trained counsellors. Afternoons are spent swimming with dolphins and stingray at Dolphin Cove, tubing down the clear waters of the Rio Bueno River, climbing the world famous Dunn’s River Falls, and shopping at the local craft and fruit markets.</p>
