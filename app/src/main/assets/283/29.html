<p>This camp is for teens and adults who want to become more effective and efficient in the water sports. Once there, you’ll find first-class paddling. But first of all the camp will focus on the rafting. With the onset of the spring snowmelt, the area serves up prime-time whitewater rafting. Rafters flock to two rivers in particular: the forest-hemmed Skykomish and the wideopen, sun-drenched Wenatchee. Both offer rollicking fun for participants of all skill levels. Campers will be offered tours on both rivers. Welcome to aquatic nirvana!</p>
