This camp will begin at Camp Cosby but will quickly move to the mountains of northern Alabama where campers will spend 2 days backpacking in some of the most beautiful areas of Alabama. The camp will then spend a day rock climbing destinations in the south. No experience necessary for this quick shot of adrenaline!</p>
