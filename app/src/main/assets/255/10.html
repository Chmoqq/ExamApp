<p align="center"><strong>What is a Ghostwriter?</strong></p>
<p>A ghostwriter is a professional writer who writes stories, books, articles, web content,<br>
political speeches, or any other type of written material. The ghostwriter writes without<br>
receiving credit for the work. Famous people such as politicians, sports figures often<br>
hire ghostwriters to pen speeches, autobiographies, or other kinds of books. Some<br>
<strong>5</strong> people work full-time as ghostwriters, making their living creating material that will<br>
never have their byline.</br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Ghostwriters can write about countless topics, whether they need to write a cookbook,<br>
a thriller, or a biography. A ghostwriter may even serve as a book doctor, polishing<br>
<strong>10</strong> the work of another author until it is publishable. This job may not be glamorous but<br>
it pays well.</br></br></br></p>
<p>Some writers work for book packagers. Book packagers hire writers to write books<br/>
from an outline or basic idea. Other writers may work for a web content company,<br/>
<strong>15</strong> writing keyword articles that will appear on a variety of web sites.</p>
<p>No matter what type of ghostwriting a writer completes, she rarely has her name<br/>
on the finished product. Neither does she receive royalties from her work. Instead,<br/>
a ghostwriter receives a flat fee for any work completed for either a company or<br/>
<strong>20</strong> individual.</p>
<p>If a writer wishes to become a ghostwriter, she is required to “audition” for a company.<br/>
This involves sending a writing sample to the company seeking new ghostwriters. If<br/>
the company likes the writing sample, it will add the writer to its list of ghostwriters.<br/>
<strong>25</strong> Immediate work may be available for ghostwriters of web content. A writer who works<br/>
for a book packager may need to wait until the packager has an opportunity that fits the<br/>
writer’s expertise or experience.</p>
<p>Ghostwriters must be excellent writers and have the ability to write quickly. They<br/>
<strong>30</strong> must be willing to remain hidden from the public eye, allowing celebrities or famous<br/>
authors to take <em><u>credit</u></em> for the written work. Whether they are provided with a detailed<br/>
outline, interview a person about his life, or write a book based on a general idea,<br/>
ghostwriters are required to write quality material while staying out of the public eye.</p>
