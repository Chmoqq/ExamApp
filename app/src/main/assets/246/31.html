<p align="center"><strong>Stonehenge Village</strong></p>
<p>Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year (23)______ the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live.</p>
<p>The village was shown to be about 4,600 years old, the same (24)______ as Stonehenge and as old as the pyramids in Egypt. The village is less than 2 miles from Stonehenge and (25)______ inside a massive manmade circular earthwork.</p>
<p>Remains found at the site (26)______ jewelry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery.</p>
<p>An old road which (27)______ from the village to a river called the Avon was also unearthed.</p>
<p>The experts believe Stonehenge was like a cemetery where (28)______ Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. “The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors,” Parker Pearson says.</p>
<p>Next to the village there was a giant wooden version of the famous stone circle. Archaeologists (29)______ this timber circle, which was only temporary because it eventually rotted away, was a symbol of life. Stonehenge, on the other (30)______, was a permanent symbol of the afterlife.</p>
<p>Parker Pearson says the recent discoveries made around the <strong>(31)______</strong> found village show that Stonehenge didn’t stand alone but was a part of a much bigger religious site. People still keep worshiping and celebrating at Stonehenge today. They meet there when the sun sets on the shortest day of winter and when it (32)______ on the longest day of summer.</p>
