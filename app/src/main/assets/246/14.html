<p><strong>Shakespeare &amp; Company</strong></p>
<p>The history of <em>Shakespeare &amp; Company</em> clearly shows that this is more than just a bookstore. George Whitman founded the Paris bookstore in 1951. He had travelled the world, at times facing hunger and thirst for days on end, finally finding hospitality in the arms of local people. His experiences shaped his store’s philosophy, and for decades it has been, as the store’s website puts it, “a home-away-from-home for many thousands of writers and visitors from around the world”.</p>
