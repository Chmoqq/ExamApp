<p><em>There is nothing like your first great bookstore discovery. Here are some of the most remarkable bookshops from all around the globe, each one of them is special in its own way.</em></p>
<p><strong>El Ateneo Grand Splendid</strong></p>
<p>Certainly one of the most beautiful bookstores, <em>El Ateneo Grand Splendid</em> is a theatre-turned-bookstore in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It features eye-catching frescoes and sculptures - and, as if the scenery wasnâ€™t enough, customers can flip through books in theatre boxes and sip a hot drink in the cafe towards the back of the stage!</p>
