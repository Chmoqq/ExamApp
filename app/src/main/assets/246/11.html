<p><strong>Barter Books</strong></p>
<p><em>Barter Books</em> is located in a beautiful old Victorian Alnwick railway station, in N orthumberland, U.K., right where passengers once bought their train tickets. Barter Books comforts its customers with a homey feel - fires in the winter, a buffet, and a waiting room for people to sip coffee and read.</p>
