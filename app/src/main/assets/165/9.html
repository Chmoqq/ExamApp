From the age of five, I’ve known that I want to be a professional writer: a journalist, a novelist, a modern-day Shakespeare, maybe. Okay, not Shakespeare. William used to give me terrible headaches back in my freshman year as I tried to figure out what he was talking about in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream </em>and<em> The Tragedy of Julius Caesar. Macbeth</em> in my sophomore year was much easier to understand.</p> <p>Regardless, I’m practically addicted to books, whether I’m reading or writing them. I can’t go a single day without writing something - a short story a novel chapter, an article - and if I do, <em>I feel a tingling in my fingers</em>, an itch that won’t go away until I sit in front of a computer or pick up a well-sharpened pencil and just let my thoughts out.</p> <p>My extended family is so widespread that whenever I meet with a cousin or an aunt I only vaguely remember, I tell him or her I’m a writer because I know it will distinguish me from all the other “kids” in the family and make me memorable. I tell my relatives about the stories I used to write as a child, the projects I'm working on now, and why I'm working so hard to make a breakthrough in the competitive world of publishing. One aunt hugged me and told me, “Just don’t forget about the rest of us when you become the next J.K. Rowling."</p> <p>Smiling, I replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t." Call it a hunch, intuition, or confidence, but I know that I will become the next J .K. Rowling. l have the ambition, I have the means, and I have the talent. My English and History teachers don’t praise my writing and tell me I have an innate writing talent because they want to be nice - they know how passionate I am about writing, and how that passion slips through my fingertips to the paper.</p> <p>I don’t really know why I love writing so much, I just do. There’s something about putting a story down on paper for friends halfway across the globe to read and understand, about finding just the right word to describe what I can see so clearly in my head, that lures me in like a siren’s song. Writing makes me who I am.</p> <p><strong>According to the text, what is the attitude of the author’s teachers to her writing?</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>They ignore her attempts to write.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>They doubt her talent for writing.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>They share her passion for writing.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>They develop her ambition to write.</div><br/></div>
