The reason that <em>Kojak </em>loved lollipops was because Savalas was a heavy smoker, and in the face of growing anti-smoking feeling in the USA he decided to suck on a lollipop instead. This became his trademark and, along with charisma and humour, it lightened the gritty storylines. The show was a huge worldwide hit and featured unknown actors who later found fame, including Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere.</p> <p><strong>The main hero of this detective series ______. </strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>can currently be seen in new TV episodes</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>was an unpleasant person and asked strange questions</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>appeared to be inexperienced and inattentive</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>has an innocent appearance but always got to the bottom of things</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>tried to solve the problem of women’s occupational discrimination</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>fights against criminals and against gender stereotypes</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>developed a characteristic new habit while giving up an old one</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>was famous for always putting work before personal life</div><br/></div>
