If all goes to plan, Jessica Watson will spend the  next eight months alone on board her 10-metre vessel, navigating 28,000  miles through some of the world’s most dangerous seas.</p> <p>Around 100  boats gathered under grey skies in the harbour to see her off. Watson  did not speak to reporters before she left, but her mother, Julie,  posted an update on the solo sailor’s blog. “I know you are all anxious  to hear from Jess, but she’s a little preoccupied on her first day, so  she asked me to post a quick note to let everyone know that the  departure went well this morning,” she wrote.</p> <p>While Watson’s  family insists the teenager is a sufficiently skilled and experienced  sailor, with expertise in navigation, electronics and maritime safety,  her plan has sparked a debate in Australia about whether someone so  young is ready for such a challenge. There was further worry after  Watson’s yacht collided with a Chinese cargo ship last month.</p> <p>Some  of Australia’s most experienced sailors, and the government of Watson’s  home state, Queensland, have urged her not to go ahead with the voyage.  Watson will be in contact with her family and support team via radio  and email, as well as updating her blog. “I think a lot of Australians  are nervous for Jessica. I’m nervous for her,” the country’s deputy  Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, told Nine Network TV. “Since she’s  determined to go, I wish her the best of luck and urge her to keep  safe.”</p> <p>A British 17-year-old, Mike Perham, became the youngest  solo round-the-world sailor in August following a nine-month voyage,  although a stop for repairs <em>’en route’</em> meant his trip did not  count as unassisted. The youngest sailor to complete the voyage  unassisted is another Australian, Jesse Martin, who was 18 when he  completed it in 1999.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>According to the text, what happened on the day of Jessica’s departure?</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>A lot of ships followed Jessica’s yacht.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>Jessica refused to talk to the journalists.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>The weather changed for the worse.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>Julia informed the public of Jessica’s voyage.</div><br/></div>
