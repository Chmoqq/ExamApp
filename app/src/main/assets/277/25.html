<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Crossing the Atlantic by Raft for WaterAid</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>Anthony Smith and his crew of the An-Tiki arrive in Philipsburg,<br>
St. Maarten after 66 days at sea</br></em></p>
<p>After 66 days at sea, a grandfather from London and his three-man crew have successfully crossed the Atlantic on a raft made of pipes.</p>
<p>Anthony Smith, 85, wanted to complete the 2,800-mile voyage to highlight the fact that a billion people worldwide live without clean water.</p>
<p>The former BBC <em>Tomorrow’s World</em> science correspondent and presenter hoped to collect £50,000 for the charity <em>WaterAid</em>. They set sail from the Canary Islands and reached the Caribbean 66 days later. Mr. Smith recruited the team of “mature and daring gentlemen” – aged between 56 and 61 – by placing an advert in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. It read: “Fancy rafting across the Atlantic? Famous traveller requires 3 crew. Must be OAP (old age pensioner). Serious adventurers only.”</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of the trip Mr Smith said: “Water strikes at the very heart of need. To voyage almost 3,000 miles upon the salty kind will make us intensely aware of places in the world that are without adequate supplies.”</p>
<p>Their vessel, named the An-Tiki, was constructed out of 39 foot lengths of pipe. It was powered by a 400-square-foot sail and travelled at an average speed of four knots. The crew had intended to end their voyage in the Bahamas, but strong winds and currents forced them to the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten.</p>
<p>Crew member John Russell, 61, from Stroud, said he was looking forward to “having a nice shower and washing the salt off me and having a nice steak to eat. We haven’t had fresh food for a long time. We’ve been living out of tins. Our fresh fruit and vegetables ran out a long time ago.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What did they mostly consume towards the end of their voyage?</p>
