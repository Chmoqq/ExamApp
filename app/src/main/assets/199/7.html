<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why I chose to Volunteer Abroad</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Andrew Marshall</em></p>
<p>Volunteering isn’t so expensive that it’s only an option for the well off. I spent 10 weeks volunteering in Arizona with America Conservation Experience, helping to preserve America’s natural beauty.</p>
<p>The trip was arranged through Bunac, a work and volunteer organisation. Altogether, it cost me around £1,000 - a sum which I covered mostly by working in my student bar.</p>
<p>Despite the self-indulgent image associated with overseas volunteer projects, the work can be hard going. I spent my time abroad maintaining trails, building fences and implementing re-vegetation projects in some of the national parks and national monuments of America.</p>
<p>Summer temperatures in Arizona stay well above 35C, not ideal if you’re carrying 5okg of concrete for 10 hours at a time. And then there’s the wildlife to deal with. One afternoon nap took a less subdued turn when I realised that a rattlesnake was resting only 3 metres from me. The experience, needless to say, improved my strength of character - and reduced my fear of the English household spider.</p>
<p>Most people volunteer because they want to give something back to the world. But in reality, you benefit just as much as the local communities and ecosystems you’re helping.</p>
<p>Spending 10 weeks in America’s most beautiful national parks and forests was an unforgettable experience. I gained a far deeper understanding of the local environment than the average tourist, meeting ex-national park rangers, who had a unique knowledge of the area’s history and ecosystem.</p>
<p>The most challenging aspects of working abroad are also the most beneficial. Being placed in an unfamiliar environment forces you to use your initiative and develop self-confidence - <em>surviving 10 days of camping in the wild is something that three years of university could never provide. </em>When I look back on the work I completed, it makes writing a dissertation and academic deadlines seem a lot more manageable.</p>
<p>But best of all, my 10 weeks were spent volunteering with young people from a mix of cultures and backgrounds - from Belgians to South Koreans. When I left Arizona, I returned home having made friends with students from across the world.</p>
