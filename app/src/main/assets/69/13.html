Once there, you’ll find stunning scenery and first-class paddling. But first of all the camp will focus on the rafting. With the onset of the spring snowmelt, the area serves up prime-time whitewater rafting. Rafters flock to two rivers in particularhe forest-hemmed Skykomish and the wide-open, sun-drenched Wenatchee.
