These devices help support and protect your body part from  strains, direct blows, and possible injury.</p> <p>To help prevent  injury, be sure to warm up adequately before practice and games. Also,  know your limits. If any body part begins to hurt, stop immediately and  rest. It’s your body’s way of telling you something is not right. So,  play, but try to do the things that can help you avoid getting hurt.</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>Keep Your Friends Fit, Too</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>Be Fair-Minded Right Along</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>Play It Safe</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>Always Strive For Victory</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>Fair and Fun</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>A Sound Mind in a Sound Body</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>Play and Win</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>Don’t Peril Your Life</div><br/></div>
