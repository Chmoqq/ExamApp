It was a fantastic adventure for the selected few who dared to join us for the week of fun. ET and his fellow llamas carried our essentials, needed for spending 3-days in the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. The Llama Trek also offers adventurers the opportunity to experience several different outdoor activities including rock climbing and whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River in Tennessee! Our week will feature 1 day of rock climbing, 3 days of trekking through the mountains of North Carolina with our llamas, and will end with our adrenaline-filled day of rafting.'</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>participants can enjoy on adventurous water ride in spring</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>campers can descend into the caves</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>camping trip is included in the program of activities</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>participants will acquaint with the underwater sports</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>two outdoor activities are on offer for teenagers</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>participants will be carried by animals</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>campers will be pleased with the perfect sightseeing</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>experience is necessary for the adventures</div><br/></div>
