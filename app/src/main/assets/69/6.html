<p>Read the text below. For questions (6–10) choose the correct answer (A, B, C or D).</p> <p><strong>Rock Star</strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="/doc/images/znotest/35/3527/Rok.jpg"/></p><p>In  the masculine universe of rock, singer-songwriter Amy Lee fits right  in. She brings her goth girl self to the table and to the recording  studio, no questions asked. The co-founder and lead vocalist for  Evanescence lets her unrelenting strength and sheer determination push  through a downpour of adrenaline-amped guitar riffs with her soothing,  classically trained piano stylings.</p> <p>Evanescence brings to the  forefront heart-pounding musical compositions fronted by Lee’s ethereal  yet reality-crashing vocals. With the debut of their album, <em>The Open Door</em>,  Lee views the journey that led her to this point of self-realization.  In the world of musical “geniuses”, Lee stands out, simply because she  realizes that it’s worth going on your own. Her mantra: trust yourself.  Believe in yourself.</p> <p>In keeping with their tradition of supreme independence, the Little Rock, Arkansas, <em>band didn’t follow the tried and tired route to becoming a stadium pleaser</em>.  Ten years back then 14-year-old Lee and former co-founder Ben Moody  paired up and focused their energies on creating a new sound. They  decided to go on their own and build their band up slowly and fiercely.</p> <p>Fate  didn’t come knocking, but rather it practically blew the door off its  hinges in the spring of 2003 when Evanescence’s debut album, <em>Fallen</em>, hit the airwaves. <em>Fallen</em> sold more than 14 million albums globally, and was certified gold or  platinum in over 35 countries. And in 2004, Evanescence was nominated  for five Grammy Awards. They’ve got two, including the biggie, Best New  Artist.</p> <p>And the Grammy experience? “It feels like you are in  high school collecting all of your awards at the end of the year,” Lee  laughs. “I really appreciate those who took the time to understand our  sound. <em>I was stoked</em>.” When she heard their name called, “I  didn’t expect it,” Lee remembers. “I had my shoes off, so, of course,  had to put them back on.”</p> <p>Armed with their second album and its first single, with the title, <em>“Call Me When You’re Sober,”</em> Lee talks about her natural growth as a female artist and coming to  terms with her artistic freedom. “I didn’t want to make the same album  twice. Now I was allowed to grow and that gave me confidence as an  artist.”</p> <p>Now, with <em>The Open Door</em>, Lee, at the ripe age of  24, is a well seasoned artist who knows exactly what she wants. And  that is her advice for women trying to break into the biz, “You have to  feel what is right in your heart. If someone is telling you to do  something just because it’s good for business, it’s a lie. Just trust  yourself; it may take longer, but not everybody knows what they are  talking about.”<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>According to the first paragraph, which of the following is true of Amy Lee?</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>She is equally keen on singing and song-writing.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>She makes a lot of efforts to succeed in rock.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>She can play both guitar and classical piano.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>She pushed hard to set up Evanescence.</div><br/></div>
