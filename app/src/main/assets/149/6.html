He decided to create an alarm clock.</p> <p>"Everybody has to deal with these every day, and <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span></em></strong> are extremely unpleasant!" he says. He asked different people what they'd like to wake up to instead of a clanging, noisy alarm. A lot of them said, "The smell of bacon."</p> <p>So Sallin and two classmates invented a new kind of alarm clock: a wooden box with a pig face and a digital clock that uses the smell of cooking bacon rather than sound to wake someone up. He explains, "There's no danger of burning, because I built it carefully. It uses halogen light bulbs instead of a flame for cooking and turns offÂ  automatically after ten minutes." Just a few easy steps are required to set the "alarm".</p> <p>"What you do is put a couple of frozen strips in the night before," says Sallin. Bacon is cured, or preserved, so there is no danger of it spoiling overnight.</p> <p>"If you set the alarm for 8:00, it will turn on at 7:50 and slow cook for ten minutes under the halogen bulbs", he says. Then the bulbs turn off and a fan blows the scent out through the nostrils of the pig.</p> <p>"So instead of an alarm or a beep or a radio, you smell yourself awake", says Sallin. "Then you can open the door on the side and pull the bacon out and eat it."</p> <p>When Sallin was a kid, he spent a lot of time making drawings of inventions. "I wanted to make an elevator in my back yard and a special tree house," he says. "But I never really thought I'd be called an inventor!"</p> <p>Sallin got an A in the class and went on to other things - but people continue to hear about his invention and email him every day asking where they can buy his alarm clock.</p> <p>These days he designs computer software, but if he decides to produce and sell his aroma alarm, maybe he can develop some other models. Any votes for cinnamon buns?</p> <p><strong>Which of the following is TRUE about Matty Sallin?</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>He taught at New York University.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>He liked fried bacon for breakfast.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>He got the idea of his alarm clock from others.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>He got up at 8 in the morning when a student.</div><br/></div>
