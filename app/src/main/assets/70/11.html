And that's just as true of friendship as it is of  romantic relationships. In many countries, especially in tribal  cultures, friendship is admired and marked by rituals - from blood  brotherhood to blessed 'marriages' between friends - that formalize an  unbreakable bond. Friendship can so often happen by the purest chance,  but what is it that makes you compatible with one person and not  another? It may lie in the stars - your Zodiac sign can reveal the type  of friend you are and who might be a suitable best friend.Certainly,  with your very best friend you can feel that you are 'soul mates' - and  in such cases, you can be sure that your friendship goes beyond your  shared taste in music!</p> <p>Historically, friendship has been  regarded far more highly than it is today. As time has passed and  society's emphasis has shifted from friendship to romantic partnerships,  the formality surrounding our relations with friends has diminished.  Friendship is very often seen as secondary to relationships between  lovers.</p> <p>The Greeks and Romans celebrated classical friendships -  platonic relationships with many of the characteristic of modern-day  love. In Greek mythology, for example, famous friendships existed  between male heroes, such as Achilles and Patroclus.</p> <p>Later,  during the Renaissance, this type of friendship made a reappearance in  the form of romantic friendship. In these relations it was not usual for  friends to set up home together as 'husband and wife'.</p> <p>Many of  the sentimental things we see lovers doing today - writing poems,  holding hands, carving each other's names on tree trunks - would then  have been practised by close friends. These romantic friendships existed  between women only into the early part of the 20th century, but  something of their intensity still survives between best friends today.</p><p><strong>Carving each other's names on tree trunks ______ .</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>was introduced only in the early part of the 21st century </div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>was celebrated during marriage rituals in the 20th century </div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>is a symbol of platonic friendships nowadays </div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>is a tradition that romantic partners practice in modern time</div><br/></div>
