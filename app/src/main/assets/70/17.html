There are a number of different ways in which  these psychic abilities can be explained:</p> <p>Some clairvoyants  believe there is a visible vibration or frequency around the body that  looks like a colourful blur. This is called the Kirilian aura and it is  said to be a personal indicator of physical, mental and spiritual  well-being:</p> <p>A strong aura may mean that the person is healthy, open and friendly.</p> <p><strong>(17)</strong> ______ .</p> <p>Auras  have been caught on film on many occasions, and some Kirilian  photographs of people with missing limbs actually show an aura around  the space where their limb once was.</p> <p>A more scientific view of clairvoyance is the belief in a „third eye‟. <strong>(18)</strong>  ______ . Its usage has since diminished due to the relative safety of modem life.</p> <p>This  „eye‟ is able to look upon the psychic plane and see the past, present  and future, or anything the clairvoyant is searching for.</p> <p>The  „third eye‟ is also important in several forms of spiritual healing,  such as Reiki. The third eye is located at the brow Chakra.</p> <p><strong>(19)</strong> ______  .
