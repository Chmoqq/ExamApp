This holiday is celebrated as the day the three wise men first saw baby Jesus and brought him gifts. On this day in Spain, many children get their Christmas presents. In Puerto Rico, before children go to sleep on January 5, they leave a box with hay under their beds so the kings will leave good presents. In France, a delicious King cake is baked. Bakers will hide a coin, jewel or little toy inside it. </p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>bonfires in the backyard</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>honoring people’s main values</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>an imaginary figure appearing in different ways</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>a festive treat containing a surprise</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>colours to make people fortunate</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>sharing food with neighbours</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>a special dish eaten with something sweet</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>greens as symbols of riches</div><br/></div>
