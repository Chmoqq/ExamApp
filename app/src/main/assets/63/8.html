<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The History of Chupa Chups Lollipops</strong></p>
<p>The  Chupa Chups company started as an idea of a Spanish citizen named Enric  Bernat in 1958. Mr. Bernat started his career at an apple jam factory.  He approached investors about a lollipop business but he failed to get  support. He took over the company himself and built the first production  machines with his own hands. He also decided that the new creation  would be called Chupa Chups, after the Spanish verb <em>chupar</em>, which translates into <em>to suck</em>.</p>
<p>Enric  Bernat knew that the bon-bons on a wooden stick would be an instant  hit. Previously candy had been marketed as a luxury and kept away from  children. However, he knew that if he could get the candy into the view  of children he would sell many more lollipops. Five years after he first  introduced the idea, Chupa Chups were being sold at over 300,000 stores  across Europe.</p>
<p>The original Chupa Chups sales force was over 600 sales agents for 300,000 locations.</p>
<p>This  amazing sales force sped across Europe to bring the good news and  delicious taste of the Chupa Chups lollipops to the masses. Without  their dedication and excitement, there would be no way the company could  have grown to the massive size that it is today.</p>
<p>Sadly, the  traditional wooden stick that was associated with Chupa Chups had to be  discontinued and replaced with a plastic one due to the lack of wood  available in Spain. The stick has remained plastic ever since. Chupa Chups were originally going to be called GOL but the name did not  stick.</p>
<p>An advertising firm came up with the idea to name them  Chupa and the delightful lollipops were born. Salvador Dali, the famous  painter, created the new Chupa Chups logo, which remains on the wrapper  on all of the lollipops to this day.</p>
<p>The Chupa Chups business went  international beginning with Asia and Australia in the 1970’s. It soon  followed to North America and the rest of Europe. The amazing results  led to a high point for the company, with the production of over 4  billion Chupa Chups lollipops during the 2003 calendar year.</p>
