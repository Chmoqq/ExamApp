<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ski Patrol: Always on Alert for Avalanche Safety</strong></p>
<p>When he was about 10 years old, Doug Driskell narrowly escaped an avalanche. He and<br>
some friends were waiting for a tram to carry them down a mountain at a ski resort, and<br>
they started fooling around. “We were just walking around having snowball fights,” he<br>
says. “All of a sudden, the snow layer took off and I ran and jumped out of the way.”</br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Within five seconds of taking off, an avalanche can move at 80 miles an hour (129<br>
kilometers an hour), so people rarely have time to jump or run out of harm’s way like<br>
Driskell did as a kid. But these days, avalanches don’t often overtake skiers at resorts<br>
because the ski patrol makes sure the slopes are safe.</br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>10</strong> As long as skiers stay in the official ski areas, they don’t have to worry. “We control the<br>
hazard, so it is unlikely you’ll get caught,” Driskell explains. “We do that by compacting<br>
the snow, and we use explosives to make an avalanche move or to test an area to see if it<br>
is unstable.” This work can be dangerous, so ski patrol members look out for each other<br>
and keep the public at a safe distance.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>15</strong> People going out into the backcountry often carry a special instrument called an<br>
avalanche transceiver that sends out a radio signal. All members of the ski patrol carry<br>
one as well, in case they get caught in an avalanche while working. The signal tells the patrol<br>
where to dig if someone ends up under the snow. Once the patrol identifies the area where a<br>
<strong>20 </strong>person might be, they push a probe down into the snow. When it hits an object, they<br>
start digging with the shovels they always carry. Everyone on the ski patrol has studied first<br>
aid, and many are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or paramedics, so they can<br>
start treating life-threatening injuries right there on the mountain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>25</strong> An Australian shepherd, a Labrador retriever, and a German shepherd are important<br>
members of the Aspen Mountain Ski Patrol team. These amazing dogs are trained to use<br/>
their keen sense of smell to seek out people unseen beneath the snow. First, they learn to<br/>
find their master, then someone else they know, then a stranger.</br></p>
