They must in addition possess the highest academic achievements and have the potential for intellectual development. Another of the main characteristics of CEUâ€™s student body is the lack of a dominant national culture. Students are admitted on the basis of merit, without any specific country quotas or preferences.</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>Information System</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>Food Services</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>Student Profile</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>Admission Instructions</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>Information Resources</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>Housing and Facilities</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>Extracurricular Activities</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>Student Orientation</div><br/></div>
