As the majority of students come to CEU as international students, the university seeks to build upon the multicultural diversity of its constituents and to enrich the overall student experience. Student activities at CEU are organized directly by the students, by their academic departments or by the Student Life Office of Student Services. Some activities support specific interests, talents and academic pursuits, while others are open to the entire university community and bring together students, faculty and staff.</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>Information System</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>Food Services</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>Student Profile</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>Admission Instructions</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>Information Resources</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>Housing and Facilities</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>Extracurricular Activities</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>Student Orientation</div><br/></div>
