Advice is cheap and all too familiar: Clear a quiet work space. Stick to a homework schedule. Set goals. Set boundaries. Do not bribe (except in emergencies). And check out the classroom. Does Junior’s learning style match the new teacher’s approach? Or the school’s philosophy? <em>Maybe the child isn’t “a good fit” for the school</em>. Such theories have developed in part because of sketchy education research that doesn’t offer clear guidance. Student traits and teaching styles surely interact; so do personalities and at-home rules. The trouble is, no one can predict how. Yet there are effective approaches to learning, at least for those who are motivated. In recent years, cognitive scientists have shown that a few simple techniques can reliably improve what matters most: how much a student learns from studying. The findings can help anyone, from a fourth grader doing long division to a retiree taking on a new language. But they directly contradict much of the common wisdom about good study habits, and they have not caught on. For instance, instead of sticking to one study location, simply alternating the room where a person studies improves retention. So does studying distinct but related skills or concepts in one sitting, rather than focusing intensely on a single thing. “We have known these principles for some time, and it’s intriguing that schools don’t pick <em>them </em>up, or that people don’t learn them by trial and error,” said Robert A. Bjork, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Instead, we walk around with all sorts of unexamined beliefs about what works that are mistaken.”</p><p>The author mentions all of the following EXCEPT ______ .</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>education research is fragmentary</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>improving learning styles is quite easy</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>teachers often ignore research on good study habits</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>elderly people rarely benefit from new learning techniques</div><br/></div>
