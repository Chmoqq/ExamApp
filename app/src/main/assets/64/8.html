Or he thought as much until he was driving his 14-year-old daughter,  Katie, and two friends to a play last year in Los Angeles.</p><p>“Katie  and her friends were sitting in the back seat talking to each other  about some movie star; I think it was Orlando Bloom,” recalled Mr.  Hampton. “I made some comment about him, I don’t remember exactly what,  but I got the typical teenager sigh and Katie rolled her eyes at me as  if to say, ‘Oh Dad, you are so out of it.’ ”<br> After that, the back-seat chattering stopped. When Mr. Hampton looked  into his rearview mirror he saw his daughter sending a text message on  her cellphone. “Katie, you shouldn’t be texting all the time,” Mr.  Hampton recalled telling her. “Your friends are there. It’s rude.” Katie  rolled her eyes again.</br></p><p>“But, Dad, we’re texting each other,”  she replied. “I don’t want you to hear what I’m saying.” Mr. Hampton  turned his attention back to the freeway. It’s a common scene these  days, one playing out in cars, kitchens and bedrooms across the country.</p><p>Children  increasingly rely on personal technological devices like cellphones to  define themselves and create social circles apart from their families,  changing the way they communicate with their parents. Adults and  teenagers alike found a form of easy communication unknown to the  inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell, and his daughters.</p><p>And  the computer, along with the Internet, has given even very young  children virtual lives distinctly separate from those of their parents  and siblings.</p><p>Social psychologists who have studied the social  impact of mobile communications, say these trends are likely to continue  as cellphones turn into mini hand-held computers, social networking  devices and pint-sized movie screens.</p><p>“For kids it has become an  identity-shaping and psyche-changing object,” Ms. Turkle said. “No one  creates a new technology really understanding how it will be used or how  it can change a society.”</p><p>Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the text?</p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>Mr. Hampton tried to teach his daughter good manners.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>Katie was sceptical about her father’s views and remarks.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>The generation gap has deepened due to technological advances.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>It was easy for Alexander Bell to communicate with his daughters.</div><br/></div>
