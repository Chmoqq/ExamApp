I love writing about my dogs, be it training, or the unconditional love they give. I am also exploring the dream of selling everything I own, packing up the dogs and seeing the US in a recreational vehicle. Any suggestions to sites, forums, etc that will help me fulfill my dream of travelling with my dogs will be appreciated!</p> <p><strong>This person __________</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>writes guidelines for newbies.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>enjoys sports and animals.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>is ready to discuss various topics.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>invites other people to participate in his/her activity.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>is interested in becoming a travel agent.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>adores communicating with other people.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>wants to travel with his/her pets.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>wants to start his/her own business</div><br/></div>
