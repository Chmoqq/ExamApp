I own three horses here in the UK. A stallion named "Perseus" who is insane and I think that's why I prefer to ride him and a new stallion named "Disraeli". He's even a bit more crazy than the other. It's always a fight of wills and I love the fight. The other is a mare named "Seripho" who is an absolute sweetheart. Besides riding, I play tennis and just started taking boxing lessons; it's a killer workout.</p> <p><strong>This person __________</strong></p><div class="quest col" style="width: 100%"><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">A</span>writes guidelines for newbies.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">B</span>enjoys sports and animals.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">C</span>is ready to discuss various topics.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">D</span>invites other people to participate in his/her activity.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">E</span>is interested in becoming a travel agent.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">F</span>adores communicating with other people.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">G</span>wants to travel with his/her pets.</div><div class="q-item"><span class="q-number">H</span>wants to start his/her own business</div><br/></div>
